## some changes

## The problem
 

## Imbalanced data
from 700k rows we end up with 
weights

## Don't Shuffle
Using kfold with shuffling the training and testing scores were nearly identical. Setting shuffle to false fixed this issue. 

we have imbalanced data, we want to know if the market will move up, down or sideways
maybe talk about how we selected days, how granular the data is
